Project Overview

	The project is a song recommendation chatbot built with Streamlit and using a MySQL database to store and retrieve song information. It allows users to interactively enter their feelings or moods and receive song recommendations based on specified emotions.

Key Functionalities

	User Input:
		Users can input their favorite songs along with details such as the artist, emotion associated with the song, 	genre, and a Spotify link. This information is stored in a MySQL database.
	Users can also describe their mood in natural language, and the application processes this input to identify the relevant 	emotions.



	Database Integration:
		The application connects to a MySQL database where song information is stored. It checks for duplicate entries 	before adding new songs to avoid redundancy.
	
	It retrieves songs that match the user's identified or described emotion.


	Emotion Identification:
		The application includes a synonym mapping and logic to detect specified emotions from user input, making the chat 	experience more flexible and user-friendly.
	
	Users can receive recommendations based on a variety of emotions (happy, sad, energetic, etc.).



	Interactive GUI:
		The application has an interactive user interface created with Streamlit that allows for user-friendly 	interactions.
	The UI dynamically changes based on the user's actions, guiding them through submitting songs or describing their mood.


	Recommendation Output:
		After processing the input, the application fetches and displays songs from the database that correspond to the 	identified emotion, providing details such as the song name, artist, genre, and a link to it on Spotify.


Technology Stack
